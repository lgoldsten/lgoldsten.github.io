<h1>Bio for Liam Goldsten</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally from the DC area, I am a computer science major at Tufts University seeking an internship to learn more about how computer science is applied in the real world. Although I am not sure what field of computer science I would like to go into, I hope that an internship will allow me to learn which aspects of the field I enjoy most. Aside from my degree, I am an avid fan of tabletop roleplaying games and I enjoy spending time playing or crafting campaigns.
